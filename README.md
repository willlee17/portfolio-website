# My Portfolio Website Repository
## Technologies / Functionalities
### I created my personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I added extra customization to the site using Bootstrap, Magnific Popup, Animate.css, and Wow.js. The preloader, popups, and smooth-scrolling / scroll-based styling was implemented using jQuery.

## Stage
### The site is deployed and hosted using Netlify. Feel free to check it out at [willlee.xyz](https://www.willlee.xyz)

## Improvements
* Improve UX by consideration of CRP and progressive rendering practices
* Better CSS implementation. Consider either BEM or OOCSS in future projects
* Smoother animation transitions
